All three topics related to AI in finance are intriguing and have potential for business applications. Considering the criteria of feasibility within a 5-day period and the business potential, the best topic to choose would be the Third Topic: AI Model for Increasing Credit Score.
Here's why this topic is a strong choice:
1. Feasibility: While all three topics are ambitious, the third topic seems to have a more focused scope that can be implemented within a 5-day period. The model's primary objective is to analyze spending habits, debt repayments, income, etc., to suggest ways to increase the user's credit score. This focused objective makes it more feasible for a short-term project.
2. Business Potential: Improving credit scores is a crucial aspect of personal finance for many individuals. If successfully implemented, the AI model can offer valuable insights and recommendations to users on how to optimize their credit scores. This service could have potential commercial value if integrated into financial advisory or credit monitoring platforms.
3. Impact: The model's impact is significant as it empowers users to make informed financial decisions that can positively affect their creditworthiness and overall financial health. The ability to explore different scenarios (such as changes in income or defaulting on repayments) allows users to understand the potential consequences of their actions.
4. Data Availability: Credit scoring and financial data are relatively common and can be obtained from bank statements and other financial sources. This readily available data can facilitate the development of the AI model.
While the other two topics are also valuable and have their merits, they may require more extensive data processing and feature engineering, which could be challenging to complete within a 5-day period. The third topic's primary focus on credit score improvement makes it a more manageable and impactful choice for the given timeframe.
Furthermore, the team could use the credit score as one of the inputs for loan approval and interest rates in credit risk assessment.
